# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next benchmarks

AMD Strix Halo `gfx1151`, 128 GB unified memory. Unsloth `UD-Q4_K_XL` target and
shared-Q8_0 MTP sidecar; Gufo uses adaptive MTP. HTTP, greedy, thinking off.
Positive gain favors Gufo.

- [Single Strix Halo](#single-strix-halo): Gufo against llama.cpp.
- [Two Strix Halos over RDMA](#two-strix-halos-over-rdma): Gufo-TP against
  Gufo on one host, deeper contexts, and the full Q8 model.

## Single Strix Halo

All Gufo tables measured October 18, 2026, with `fec4759d` and the
validated host-memory and cache-stall fixes.

The focused October 21 follow-up is separate.
Reference results remain unchanged from September 22–23.
llama.cpp uses `b11069` for AR and `6fcaa16f` for MTP.

Gufo numerical regression checks pass; individual functional timing limits
remain documented in [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md). Historical llama.cpp MTP values are retained as requested:
a separate check of that pin did not match its own AR output, so this review
does not requalify those comparisons. [Review evidence](artifacts/decode-kernels-review.json).

At 128K, Gufo reaches 1557.18 tok/s AR prefill and 1481.19 tok/s MTP prefill.
All 24 single-user rows match the previous qualified capture in completion
hashes and prompt/cache counts.
All 63 concurrent tg128 completions match the corresponding C1 AR control.
Repetitive MTP through 64K reports mean ± sample standard deviation across
the sweep and one focused repeat. Initial PP dips at 16K/32K/64K did not
repeat against current main; both observations remain included.
Prior mixed MTP C2 repeats show two draft-controller trajectories (about 54
and 60 tok/s, identical text), so its gain is not entirely attributable to lookup.

## Sampled decode follow-up, October 21

Focused production comparison against main `0c03748a`, candidate `1d3b8c68`,
with the same Nix toolchain, weights and ordered request histories. Model
defaults are used for sampled requests; concurrency is physical, and the C>1
rates sum the individual decode rates. These measurements qualify the decode
changes separately from the complete October 18 tables below. They do not
refresh the reference data.

| Workload | Main tok/s | Candidate tok/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Copy existing code, default sampling, C1 | 109.59 | 112.30 |
| Generate new code, default sampling, C1 | 75.18 | 75.40 |
| Generate prose, default sampling, C1 | 39.74 | 39.76 |
| Thinking/code, default sampling, C1 | 51.93 | 52.05 |
| Greedy code control, C1 | 70.42 | 70.51 |
| Default-sampled copying, C2 aggregate | 132.93 | 135.45 |

These 128-token screens retain identical outputs and prompt/cache counts;
all 276 matched request/phase measurements pass the 5% and 3 ms gate. The
screens measure speed, not complete coding-task accuracy.

Earlier complete-workflow and mixed-cohort checks against main `da5d5a2b`,
before rebasing onto the merged small-prefill changes, remain separate:

| Workload | Main tok/s | Candidate tok/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Extraction with thinking, 726 tokens | 82.52 | 82.76 |
| Generate and execute URI tests, 441 tokens | 78.54 | 78.79 |
| File-edit tool call at 32K, thinking off | 76.42 | 77.01 |
| File-edit tool call at 32K, thinking on | 72.40 | 72.47 |
| Mixed greedy/default-sampled copying, C2 | 137.63 | 139.50 |
| Mixed greedy/default-sampled copying, C4 | 200.22 | 202.94 |
| Mixed greedy/default-sampled copying, C6 | 218.78 | 221.54 |
| Mixed greedy/default-sampled copying, C8 | 237.34 | 240.87 |

All outputs in these matched captures agree. The extraction, URI and file-edit
fixtures check their actual results. A real Pi conversation also passes, with ten
successful tool calls and executed assertions; its unseeded run is correctness
evidence, not a matched speed claim.

Canonical greedy pp2048/tg128 spots on current main and candidate use the
original single-user context capacity and cache preparation:

| Mode | Cached depth | Main PP | Candidate PP | Main TG | Candidate TG |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AR | 0 | 1793.17 | 1792.97 | 28.87 | 28.88 |
| AR | 32,768 | 1651.93 | 1650.85 | 28.74 | 28.77 |
| MTP mixed | 0 | 1724.11 | 1727.57 | 36.18 | 36.31 |
| MTP mixed | 32,768 | 1607.67 | 1605.39 | 40.56 | 40.51 |
| MTP repetitive | 0 | 1737.22 | 1733.71 | 118.61 | 120.25 |
| MTP repetitive | 32,768 | 1609.07 | 1609.65 | 113.61 | 115.07 |

Concurrent greedy TG: repetitive C2 166.15 → 170.96, repetitive C8
245.05 → 247.09, mixed C8 133.65 → 134.61 tok/s. All measured concurrent
completions match isolated AR controls.

Mixed C2 remains variable: the current pair is 62.17 → 55.30 tok/s and the
focused reverse-order control is 53.30 → 55.29. The pre-rebase pair was
62.17 → 55.36 and its reverse-order repeat was 53.30 → 64.03. Main proposes
93 versus 39 drafts per response across its current runs; the final candidate
proposes 56 in both. Both builds produce identical text. These observations do
**not** establish a C2 speedup or a confirmed slowdown. Individual cache,
queue and preparation timing flags remain visible in the
[quality record](QUALITY.md#exact-sampled-decode-october-21-2026); no blanket
timing pass is claimed.

## Two Strix Halos over RDMA

Gufo-TP runs one model on two such hosts: every layer is split between them,
and they exchange partial sums over RDMA ([how it works](TP2.md)).
The workloads are those of the one-host tables; "Gufo" is the same build on
one host, and gain is Gufo-TP over it. With twice the memory, single users
also reach depths one host cannot (context capacity 262144). Every RDMA table
was measured on October 9, 2026 (`c85349b5`) over USB4 RoCE v2, with the
same-build one-host runs beside them, in the balanced power mode (85 W
sustained), so prefill is lower than in the one-host tables above; decode is
not power-bound. Over USB4 a fresh 2K prompt prefills more slowly than on one
host; with a cached prefix, prefill gains 3–15%.
